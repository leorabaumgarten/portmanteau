  <h4 class="text-lg font-black">What is a portmanteau?</h4>
  <p>
    Even if you've never mashed two words together yourself, it's likely that
    you've been making use of portmanteaus your whole life. Portmanteaus are
    formed by taking two or more words and blending their sounds together in
    order to create a new word that combines their meanings. Popular English
    portmanteaus include "motel" (motor + hotel), "brunch" (breakfast + lunch),
    "mockumentary" (mock + documentary), and "smog" (smoke + fog).
  </p>
  <p>
    Linguistically speaking, portmanteaus (also referred to as blends), can be
    categorized in several different ways. For the pruposes of this project,
    we've decided to focus on continuous phonologically overlapping
    portmanteaus, meaning that we're looking to generate portmanteaus based on
    the longest set of sounds that are shared between the two input words.
    However, not every word has sounds in common with every other word, so
    depending on the words you input, you may end up with a non-overlapping
    portmanteau, which we've computed by joining the first word up to its
    middlemost vowel with the second word after its first vowel. In rare cases,
    we'll generate a reverse portmanteau, where the word you enter second is
    chosen to be the first word, in order to avoid some of the weirder sounding
    and looking combinations that can result.

  <h4 class="text-md font-black">Leora Baumgarten, Backend</h4>
  <p>
    Leora has come up with some pretty good portmantueas over the years, but
    there are at least three (or maybe three hundred) groan-worthy blends for
    every clever one she shares<code>&#8212;</code>just ask her friends and
    family. She designed this project so that she could impress everyone with
    its masterful portmanteaus. She's currently working towards an M.S. in
    computational linguistics at Brandeis University, where she gets to explore
    her passion for language and language technology.

  <p>
    Kayla is not as good as portmantueas as Leora, and cannot impress friends
    and family with portmanteas. She is currently working on a B.A, studying
    Computer Science at the University of Rochester. She also enjoys a little
    CSS here and theres
